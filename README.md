## Questions
1. Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes
  - I didn't encounter any significant issues and enjoyed creating this website.
  - While working on it, I made changes to my **initial portfolio** design that improved the website and user experience. These changes included:

    - adding text and a button, incorporating a transparent background to the header / main banner.
    - Opting for different background images for the 'Contact' and 'About' pages
    - Adding more information about employees on the 'About' page
    - Including a 'read more' link to the 'About' page text for medium and small screens

2. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?
  - One of the most valuable lessons I gained from creating my web portfolio was realizing the significant efficiency and time-saving benefits of utilizing Bootstrap. This experience not only allowed me to streamline the development process but also provided me with a deeper understanding of coding principles. Now, I have a much clearer grasp of coding concepts and feel more confident in my abilities as a developer than ever before

3. Finally, include a list of any assets or resources you used that was not your own, including any frameworks, libraries, plugins, fonts, or images.
  - I have used these resources to complete my assignment:
    - https://getbootstrap.com/
    - https://derivv.com/
    - https://animate.style/
